    name: A Natural Farming System For Sustainable Agriculture In the Tropics
    description: "<p>This helpful book has been provided free of charge by the Aloha
      House to the wider network. ECHO Asia believes that these resources are well
      researched and useful to the majority of ECHO Asia network members. For more
      information, please contact Keith Mikkelson, the author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">===========================================================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      book is an important work for tropical agriculture. There are very few resources
      that are truly &ldquo;organic&rdquo; and practical for the everyday farmer in
      the tropical setting. This book covers material that is extremely useful for
      the day-to-day operation of a farm or garden. It contains planning material
      that takes into account logistics as well as timetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      is not a guide for the agronomy student. I have identified several species that
      work well for us, but I do not have a planting guide for rice or corn or vegetables.
      These guides are readily obtained from seed suppliers and general horticultural
      works. If the reader looks carefully, he will find that I have given a system
      for natural fertilization in place of the chemical recommendations by traditional
      methods. Some creative adaptation will be required if your conditions and climate
      vary. We have a high acid clay soil that was rainforest at one time. Over the
      years a cogan grass has established itself. That is our starting point and our
      formulas can be changed for particular challenges that the reader may be facing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      is not a How-to-do-it manual. Rather, this is a HOW-WE-DO-IT book based on my
      &ldquo;Sustainable Agriculture in the Tropics&rdquo; manual. It has been used
      to train and equip hundreds of small-scale farmers and gardeners in the natural
      farming adventure. It is an adventure worth taking, as few things in life will
      improve general health and well being as much as quality food products grown
      to their full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keith O. Mikkelson &ndash; Fall 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a

      /> There is often a critical gap between knowing what could be helpful and then
      making that information known so that it can be put into practice. Filling that
      gap is the specialty of an organization called Modernizing Extension and Advisory
      Services (MEAS; https://meas.illinois.ed). MEAS has produced a wealth of informational
      materials focused on best strategies, tools and resources for strengthening
      the role that rural extension systems play in increasing food production and
      farm income. Their publications are relevant to those looking for the best ways
      to transfer knowledge and skills to farmers coping with various challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With
      generous support from MEAS, ECHO completed a project to extract, summarize and
      disseminate key MEAS insights and lessons to our growing network of field-based
      practitioners. This resulted in twelve summaries of MEAS materials shown on
      this web page. <a href=\"http://www.echocommunity.org/resources/2be6f89a-2fcd-4efa-9450-87572238bc13\">Technical
      Note 83</a>, also completed with support from MEAS, captures key lessons and
      practices from community human/animal health programs that apply to agriculture
      extension efforts. It is especially relevant to those looking for insights on
      how to utilize community-based extension workers to reach farmers in areas where
      it is not practical to bring in outside personnel to teach and conduct extension
      activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who wish to study a particular topic in
      greater depth, references and suggestions are provided for further reading.
      We trust that these documents will help you be more effective in communicating
      hunger-related options among the farmers you serve.</p>\r\n"

      lives of small-scale farmers in parts of the world where resources are limited.
      The practices discussed in each BPN are those that ECHO staff are most familiar
      with, based on first-hand experience or on reports from ECHO&#39;s network of
      development practitioners. Usually the practices mentioned in a BPN have been
      featured in previously-written Technical Notes or in our quarterly agricultural
      bulletin, ECHO Development Notes. References to these and any other sources
      of information are noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each BPN, therefore, is an excellent
      gateway to a wealth of ECHO materials on significant farmer concerns. Every
      BPN begins with a description of the issue or topic being addressed. Next, recognizing
      that there is rarely a solution that applies to every circumstance, important
      principles are presented that can help guide decision-making in selecting and
      implementing the best practices that follow. At the end of each BPN, there is
      a list of resources for further reading, with links to supporting publications
      or presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are the BPNs developed to date. We are

    description: "<div style=\"margin-top:-20px\">\r\n<h3><small>Provided by Steve
      Hodges - African Agriculture Risk Management Services</small></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Within
      the internationally recognized field of agricultural risk assessment and management,
      risks can be evaluated according to three basic criteria :</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Impact:</strong>&nbsp;
      &nbsp;In other words, how severe will the risk event be if it actually happens?
      Some risks can destroy the whole year&#39;s farm income and even destroy assets;
      other risks are milder in impact.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong>&nbsp;
      How likely is this risk to come about? Some risks are rare and unpredictable,
      others are more likely to happen.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Manageability:</strong>
      &nbsp;Independent of how severe or how likely a risk is, some risks are out
      of the control of the farmer, others can be handled to a large or small degree.
      It makes sense to prioritize scarce resources on risks which can actually be
      managed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

      Conditions&nbsp; (1996)<br />\r\nLaura S. Meitzner&nbsp;and&nbsp;Martin L. Price</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      is a book of practical ideas. It is written for people who help those who live
      and make their living under difficult conditions in the tropics and subtropics.
      What should a development worker do to assist a community? There are no simple
      answers, but there are many possibilities--plants, techniques, and technologies--which
      hold potential. For fifteen years, ECHO has sought out information on these
      ideas for the quarterly networking bulletin ECHO Development Notes (EDN). Many
      people have contributed their insights to share with our network of over 4000
      people in 140 countries. If you are interested in improving the lives of small
      farmers, we welcome your active participation in our network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      book is based on the<u> first 51 issues of EDN</u>. The ideas in EDN come from
      questions or experiences of field workers, the scientific research done in support
      of their work, and many newsletters from around the world which ECHO&#39;s staff
      monitor for worthy items. This collection is not intended to be a complete handbook.
      There are important topics which are not mentioned, and in many cases you are
      referred to other resources for background information or specialized details.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4>More
